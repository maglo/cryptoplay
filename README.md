==========

Attempts to break a Vigenere Cipher variant.

The plaintext message *m* is encrypted by XOR-ing each byte in *m* using a byte from an *N*-byte key *k*, producing a ciphertext *c*.
If *N* < [*m*|, *k* is repeated.

<P>c<sub>i</sub> = m<sub>i</sub> âŠ• k<sub>[i mod N]</sub></P>

The program expects the ciphertext to be encoded with hexadecimal two-byte representations for each byte in *c*.

So if *c* is `0xDE 0xAD 0xBE 0xEF` it should be endoced as `DEADBEEF`.

To run the program:

	python vigenere.py crack -f challenge --keylength 7

The keylength brute forcer is not implemented yet. 
The keylength could be determined by [vigenereSolveR](https://github.com/maglo/vigenereSolveR/blob/master/determineKeyLength.R).
